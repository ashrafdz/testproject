                        <h2>The steps:</h2>
                        <ol class="steps-list">
                            <li>To make the soup filling, heat 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil in a large pan until hot, then add the chicken thighs and cook on each side for 4 minutes or until golden brown. Remove the thighs from the pan and add a splash of water to deglaze the pan, then add the shallots and the remaining 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil. Reduce the heat and sauté the shallots for 5 minutes until wilted, then add the garlic and all-purpose flour and cook for 1 minute.</li>
                            <li>Dissolve the Knorr Chicken Stock Cube in the boiling water, then add the chicken back into the pan, cover with a lid, and simmer on low heat for 45 minutes to 1 hour until the chicken is tender and fully cooked. Remove and shred the thighs, then return them to the sauce. Stir in the potatoes, vegetables, and spring onions until well combined and let cool.</li>
                            <li>To make the pastry, beat the butter and cream cheese on medium-high speed in a stand mixer until well combined. Add the salt and sugar to the butter and cream cheese mixture and mix well. Scrape the sides of the bowl and add the all-purpose flour, mixing on low until the pastry has a shaggy texture and is not fully combined.</li>
                            <li>Transfer the dough to a floured surface and knead a few times to combine, then divide into two equal parts. Shape each part into a disc, wrap in cling wrap, and refrigerate for at least 2 hours before rolling out.</li>
                            <li>To make the pies, preheat the oven to 200°C / 180°C fan. Divide the chicken soup mixture between 2 heatproof bowls. Roll out the pastry discs to approximately 1 centimeter thick and cut circles from the pastry that are approximately 1 centimeter wider than your heatproof bowls. Place the pastry discs over the soup and use your thumb and forefinger to crimp the edges of the pastry.</li>
                            <li>Bake the pies in the oven for 20 - 25 minutes, until the pastry is risen and golden brown and the filling is fully heated. While the pies are in the oven, mix the garnish ingredients in a bowl for sprinkling.</li>
                            <li>Once cooked, remove the pies from the oven and garnish with the garnish ingredients before serving immediately.</li>
