                            <li>The ongoing Tokyo Olympics has captured the attention of sports fans worldwide. Events like this showcase the competition for medals in various sports and the breaking of world records. Have you ever wondered how these athletes have such extraordinary stamina compared to those who do not enjoy sports? Naturally, athletes and fitness enthusiasts undergo continuous training, including TABATA exercises, which are highly effective for burning fat and building muscle.

                                <br><br>This 20-minute per session exercise was introduced by Dr. Izumi Tabata to train Olympic athletes around the 1990s. It is similar to other high-intensity interval training (HIIT) workouts, focusing on maximum effort in a short time with brief rest periods. As a result, it has been proven to burn fat, increase endurance, and help with weight loss.
                                <br><br>Although TABATA exercises may seem easy, they are not suitable for those who are new to fitness activities. For example, you can do:

                                <br><br>Push-ups (4 minutes)
                                <br>Squats (4 minutes)
                                <br>Burpees (4 minutes)
                                <br>Mountain climbers (4 minutes)</li>
